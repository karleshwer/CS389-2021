    <string name="article_text">Tonight, I\'m gonna have myself a real good time \n
I feel alive and the world I\'ll turn it inside out, yeah \n
And floating around in ecstasy \n
So don\'t stop me now don\'t stop me\n
\'Cause I\'m having a good time, having a good time\n
I\'m a shooting star, leaping through the sky\n
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity\n
I\'m a racing car, passing by like Lady Godiva\n
I\'m gonna go, go, go\n
There\'s no stopping me\n
I\'m burnin\' through the sky, yeah\n
Two hundred degrees\n
That\'s why they call me Mister Fahrenheit\n
I\'m traveling at the speed of light\n
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you\n
Don\'t stop me now, I\'m having such a good time\n
I\'m having a ball\n
Don\'t stop me now\n
If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call\n
Don\'t stop me now (\'cause I\'m having a good time)\n
Don\'t stop me now (yes, I\'m havin\' a good time)\n
I don\'t want to stop at all\n
Yeah, I\'m a rocket ship on my way to Mars\n
On a collision course\n
I am a satellite, I\'m out of control\n
I am a sex machine, ready to reload\n
Like an atom bomb about to\n
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh explode\n
I\'m burnin\' through the sky, yeah\n
Two hundred degrees\n
That\'s why they call me Mister Fahrenheit\n
I\'m traveling at the speed of light\n
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you\n
Don\'t stop me, don\'t stop me\n
Don\'t stop me, hey, hey, hey\n
Don\'t stop me, don\'t stop me\n

Have a good time, good time\n
